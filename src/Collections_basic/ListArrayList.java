		  * Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements. 
		  * It is like an array, but there is no size limit. We can add or remove elements anytime. 
		  * So, it is much more flexible than the traditional array. It is found in the java.util package. 
		  * It is like the Vector in C++.
		  * The ArrayList in Java can have the duplicate elements also. 
		  * It implements the List interface so we can use all the methods of List interface here. 
		  * The ArrayList maintains the insertion order internally.
		  * It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List interface.
		  * The important points about Java ArrayList class are:
		  * Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements.
		  * Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order.
		  * Java ArrayList class is non synchronized.
		  * Java ArrayList allows random access because array works at the index basis.
		  * In ArrayList, manipulation is little bit slower than the LinkedList in Java because a lot of shifting needs to occur if any element is removed from the array list.
